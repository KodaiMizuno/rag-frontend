from 0. Optionally, a manually
specified list of desired indices can be passed to the index argument.
a    -1
b    10
c     2
dtype: int64
Index(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='object')
Indices can also be changed after initialization.
first     -1
second    10
third      2
dtype: int64
Index(['first', 'second', 'third'], dtype='object')
Much like when working with NumPy arrays, we can select a single value or a set of values from a Series. To do
so, there are three primary methods:
1. A single label.
2. A list of labels.
3. A filtering condition.
To demonstrate this, letʼs define a new Series s.
 # Accessing the Index of the Series
 s.index
s = pd.Series([-1 , 1 0 , 2 ], index = ["a", "b", "c"])
s
s.index
s.index = ["first", "second", "third"]
s
s.index
1 . 3 . 0 . 1  S e l e c t i on  i n  S e r i e sa    4
b   -2
c    0
d    6
dtype: int64
4
a    4
c    0
dtype: int64
Perhaps the most interesting (and useful) method of selecting data from a Series is by using a filtering condition.
