bject')
And for the shape of the DataFrame, we can use DataFrame.shape to get the number of rows followed by the number of
columns:
(187, 6)
2.3 Slicing in DataFrames
Now that weʼve learned more about DataFrames, letʼs dive deeper into their capabilities.
The API (Application Programming Interface) for the DataFrame class is enormous. In this section, weʼll discuss several
methods of the DataFrame API that allow us to extract subsets of data.
The simplest way to manipulate a DataFrame is to extract a subset of rows and columns, known as slicing.
Common ways we may want to extract data are grabbing:
The first or last n rows in the DataFrame.
Data with a certain label.
Data at a certain position.
We will do so with four primary methods of the DataFrame class:
1. .head and .tail
2. .loc
3. .iloc
4. []
The simplest scenario in which we want to extract data is when we simply want to select the first or last few rows of the
DataFrame.
To extract the first n rows of a DataFrame df, we use the
