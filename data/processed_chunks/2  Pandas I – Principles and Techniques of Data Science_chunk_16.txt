e are a couple of things we should note. Firstly, unlike conventional Python, pandas allows us to slice string values (in our
example, the column labels). Secondly, slicing with .loc is inclusive. Notice how our resulting DataFrame includes every row
and column between and including the slice labels we specified.
Equivalently, we can use a list to obtain multiple rows and columns in our elections DataFrame.
Year Candidate Party Popular vote
0 1824 Andrew Jackson Democratic-Republican 151271
1 1824 John Quincy Adams Democratic-Republican 113142
2 1828 Andrew Jackson Democratic 642806
3 1828 John Quincy Adams National Republican 500897
Lastly, we can interchange list and slicing notation.
