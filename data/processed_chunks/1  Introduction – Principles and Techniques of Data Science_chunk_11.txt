e. For
example, the column named “Result” stores whether or not the candidate won the election.
Your work in Data 8 helped you grow very familiar with using and interpreting data stored in a tabular format. Back
then, you used the Table class of the datascience library, a special programming library created specifically for
Data 8 students.
In Data 100, we will be working with the programming library pandas, which is generally accepted in the data
science community as the industry- and academia-standard tool for manipulating tabular data (as well as the
inspiration for Petey, our panda bear mascot).
Using pandas, we can
Arrange data in a tabular format.
Extract useful information filtered by specific conditions.
Operate on data to gain new insights.
Apply NumPy functions to our data (our friends from Data 8).
Perform vectorized computations to speed up our analysis (Lab 1).
To begin our work in pandas, we must first import the library into our Python environment. This will allow us to
