Earlier, we explained how a Series was synonymous to a column in a DataFrame. It follows, then, that a DataFrame is
equivalent to a collection of Series, which all share the same Index.
df_list = pd.DataFrame([[1 , "one"], [2 , "two"]], columns = ["Number", "Description"])
df_list
2 . 1 . 1 . 0 . 2  F r o m  a  D i c t i o n a r y
df_dict = pd.DataFrame({
    "Fruit": ["Strawberry", "Orange"], 
    "Price": [5 . 4 9 , 3 . 9 9 ]
})
df_dict
df_dict = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"Fruit":"Strawberry", "Price":5 . 4 9 }, 
        {"Fruit": "Orange", "Price":3 . 9 9 }
    ]
)

We can turn individual Series into a DataFrame using two common methods (shown below):
0
r1 a1
r2 a2
r3 a3
0
r1 b1
r2 b2
r3 b3
To merge the two Series and specify their column names, we use the following syntax:
A-colum
