range of applications from science and medicine to sports.
While data science has immense potential to address challenging problems facing society by enhancing our critical
thinking, it can also be used obscure complex decisions and reinforce historical trends and biases. This course will
implore you to consider the ethics of data science within its applications.
Data science is fundamentally human-centered and facilitates decision-making by quantitatively balancing
tradeoffs. To quantify things reliably, we must use and analyze data appropriately, apply critical thinking and
skepticism at every step of the way, and consider how our decisions affect others.
Ultimately, data science is the application of data-centric, computational, and inferential thinking to:
Understand the world (science).
Solve problems (engineering).
