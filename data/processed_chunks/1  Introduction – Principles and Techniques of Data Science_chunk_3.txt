 1  Introduction A true mastery of data science requires a deep theoretical understanding and strong grasp of domain expertise.
This course will help you build on the former – specifically, the foundation of your technical knowledge, allowing
you to take data and produce useful insights on the worldʼs most challenging and ambiguous problems.
To set you up for success, weʼve organized concepts in Data 100 around the data science lifecycle: an iterative
process that encompasses the various statistical and computational building blocks of data science.
1.1 Data Science Lifecycle
The data science lifecycle is a high-level overview of the data science workflow. Itʼs a cycle of stages that a data
scientist should explore as they conduct a thorough analysis of a data-driven problem.
There are many variations of the data science lifecycle but the core ideas are all the same. In Data 100, we visualize
the sta
