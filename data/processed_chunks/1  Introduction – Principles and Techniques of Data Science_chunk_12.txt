riends from Data 8).
Perform vectorized computations to speed up our analysis (Lab 1).
To begin our work in pandas, we must first import the library into our Python environment. This will allow us to
use pandas data structures and methods in our code.
There are three fundamental data structures in pandas:
1. Series: 1D labeled array data; best thought of as columnar data.
2. DataFrame: 2D tabular data with rows and columns.
3. Index: A sequence of row/column labels.
DataFrames, Series, and Indices can be represented visually in the following diagram, which considers the first
few rows of the elections dataset.
# `pd` is the conventional alias for Pandas, as `np` is for NumPy
import pandas as pdNotice how the DataFrame is a two-dimensional object — it contains both rows and columns. The Series above is
a singular column of this DataFrame, namely the Result column. Both contain an Index, or a shared list of row
labels (the integers from 0 to 4, inclusive).
Today, we will start off from S
