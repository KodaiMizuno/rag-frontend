To select multiple rows and columns, we can use Python slice notation. Here, we select the rows from labels 0 to 3 and the
columns from labels "Year" to "Popular vote". Notice that unlike Python slicing, .loc is inclusive of the right upper
bound.
Year Candidate Party Popular vote
0 1824 Andrew Jackson Democratic-Republican 151271
1 1824 John Quincy Adams Democratic-Republican 113142
2 1828 Andrew Jackson Democratic 642806
3 1828 John Quincy Adams National Republican 500897
Suppose that instead, we want to extract all column values for the first four rows in the elections DataFrame. The shorthand
: is useful for this.
