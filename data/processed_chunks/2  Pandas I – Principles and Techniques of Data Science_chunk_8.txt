elections.reset_index(inplace = True) # Resetting the index so we can set it again
# This sets the index to the "Party" column
elections.set_index("Party")
# This resets the index to be the default list of integer
elections.reset_index(inplace=True) 
elections.indexRangeIndex(start=0, stop=187, step=1)
It is also important to note that the row labels that constitute an index donʼt have to be unique. While index values can be
unique and numeric, acting as a row number, they can also be named and non-unique.
Here we see unique and numeric index values.
However, here the index values are not unique.
2.2 DataFrame Attributes: Index, Columns, and Shape
On the other hand, column names in a DataFrame are almost always unique. Looking back to the elections dataset, it
wouldnʼt make sense to have two columns named "Candidate". Sometimes, youʼll want to extract these different values, in
particular, the list of row and column labels.
For index/row labels, use Da
