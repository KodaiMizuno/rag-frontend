The code above code stores our DataFrame object in the elections variable. Upon inspection, our elections DataFrame
has 182 rows and 6 columns (Year, Candidate, Party, Popular Vote, Result, %). Each row represents a single record —
in our example, a presidential candidate from some particular year. Each column represents a single attribute or feature of the
