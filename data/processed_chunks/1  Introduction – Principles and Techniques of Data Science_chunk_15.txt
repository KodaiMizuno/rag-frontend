Perhaps the most interesting (and useful) method of selecting data from a Series is by using a filtering condition.
First, we apply a boolean operation to the Series. This creates a new Series of boolean values.
a     True
b    False
c    False
d     True
dtype: bool
We then use this boolean condition to index into our original Series. pandas will select only the entries in the
original Series that satisfy the condition.
a    4
d    6
dtype: int64
s = pd.Series([4 , -2 , 0 , 6 ], index = ["a", "b", "c", "d"])
s
1 . 3 . 0 . 1 . 1  A S i n g l e  L a b e l
# We return the value stored at the index label "a"
s["a"] 
1 . 3 . 0 . 1 . 2  A L i s t  o f  L a b e l s
# We return a Series of the values stored at the index labels "a" and "c"
s[["a", "c"]] 
1 . 3 . 0 . 1 . 3  A F i l t e r i n g  C o n d i t i o n
# Filter condition: select all elements greater than 0
s > 0  
s[s > 0 ]
