ies above is
a singular column of this DataFrame, namely the Result column. Both contain an Index, or a shared list of row
labels (the integers from 0 to 4, inclusive).
Today, we will start off from Series object.
1.3 Series
A Series represents a column of a DataFrame; more generally, it can be any 1-dimensional array-like object. It
contains both:
A sequence of values of the same type.
A sequence of data labels called the index.
In the cell below, we create a Series named s.
0     welcome
1          to
2    data 100
dtype: object
array(['welcome', 'to', 'data 100'], dtype=object)
s = pd.Series(["welcome", "to", "data 100"])
s
 # Accessing data values within the Series
 s.valuesRangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)
By default, the index of a Series is a sequential list of integers beginning from 0. Optionally, a manually
specified list of desired indices can be passed to the index argument.
a    -1
b    10
c     2
dtype: int64
Index(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='object')
Indices can also be ch
