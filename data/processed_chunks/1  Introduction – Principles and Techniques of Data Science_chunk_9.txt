 rather than a hard set of requirements. In our
journey exploring the lifecycle, weʼll cover both the underlying theory and technologies used in data science. By
the end of the course, we hope that you start to see yourself as a data scientist.
With that, weʼll begin by introducing one of the most important tools in exploratory data analysis: pandas.
In this sequence of lectures, we will dive right into things by having you explore and manipulate real-world data.
Weʼll first introduce pandas, a popular Python library for interacting with tabular data.
1.2 Tabular Data and pandas
Data scientists work with data stored in a variety of formats. This class focuses primarily on tabular data — data
that is stored in a table.
Tabular data is one of the most common systems that data scientists use to organize data. This is in large part due
to the simplicity and flexibility of tables. Tables allow us to represent each observation, or instance of collecting
data from an individual, as its own ro
