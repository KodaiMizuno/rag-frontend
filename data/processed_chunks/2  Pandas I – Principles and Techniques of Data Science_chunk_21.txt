iloc? In most cases, .loc is generally safer to use. You can
imagine .iloc may return incorrect values when applied to a dataset where the ordering of data can change. However, .iloc
can still be useful — for example, if you are looking at a DataFrame of sorted movie earnings and want to get the median
earnings for a given year, you can use .iloc to index into the middle.
Overall, it is important to remember that:
.loc performances label-based extraction.
.iloc performs integer-based extraction.
The [] selection operator is the most baffling of all, yet the most commonly used. It only takes a single argument, which may
be one of the following:
1. A slice of row numbers.
2. A list of column labels.
3. A single-column label.
That is, [] is context-dependent. Letʼs see some examples.
Say we wanted the first four rows of our elections DataFrame.
elections.iloc[:, 0 :3 ]
